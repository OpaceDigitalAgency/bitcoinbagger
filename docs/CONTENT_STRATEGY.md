## FAQ Structure

### Getting Started
**Q: What's the best way to invest in Bitcoin?**
A: It depends on your risk tolerance, technical knowledge, and investment goals. Direct Bitcoin ownership offers full control but requires security knowledge. ETFs provide easier access through traditional brokers but with management fees.

**Q: Are Bitcoin ETFs better than buying Bitcoin directly?**
A: Each has advantages. ETFs offer easier access through traditional brokers and no custody concerns, but have management fees and don't give you actual Bitcoin. Direct ownership offers full control and no fees but requires technical knowledge for secure storage.

**Q: Can I invest in Bitcoin through my pension/401k?**
A: In some cases, yes. Some pension providers now offer Bitcoin ETFs, and Bitcoin IRAs are available in the US. Check with your provider about cryptocurrency investment options.

### Investment Vehicles

**Q: What's the difference between Bitcoin ETFs and ETPs?**
A: ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are available in the US and track Bitcoin's price. ETPs (Exchange-Traded Products) are similar instruments available in Europe. Both allow Bitcoin exposure through traditional stock exchanges.

**Q: Which companies hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet?**
A: Major companies include MicroStrategy (largest corporate holder), Tesla, Block (formerly Square), Marathon Digital, and many others. Our tracker shows real-time holdings.

**Q: Are Bitcoin mining stocks a good Bitcoin investment?**
A: Mining stocks offer leveraged exposure to Bitcoin prices but come with additional risks like operational costs, regulatory changes, and company-specific issues. They're more volatile than direct Bitcoin investment.

### Risks and Regulations

**Q: Is Bitcoin investment legal in my country?**
A: Bitcoin is legal in most developed countries but regulations vary. Always check your local laws and tax obligations. We provide country-specific guides for major markets.

**Q: What are the tax implications of Bitcoin investment?**
A: Tax treatment varies by country and investment method. Generally, Bitcoin gains are subject to capital gains tax. ETFs may have different tax treatment than direct Bitcoin ownership. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation.

**Q: How risky is Bitcoin investment?**
A: Bitcoin is a high-risk, high-reward investment with significant price volatility. Only invest what you can afford to lose and consider it part of a diversified portfolio.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do I store Bitcoin safely?**
A: For long-term storage, hardware wallets (cold storage) are recommended. For smaller amounts or active trading, reputable exchange wallets may be sufficient. Never store large amounts on exchanges long-term.

**Q: What's the difference between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?**
A: Bitcoin is the first and largest cryptocurrency, designed as digital money. Other cryptocurrencies have different purposes and risk profiles. Our site focuses specifically on Bitcoin investment vehicles.
